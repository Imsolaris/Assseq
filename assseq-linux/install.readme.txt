Install:

---------- SIMPLEST ------------

download the installer from http://ormbunkar.se/downloads/linux and run:

assseq.install.run

(this is a executable archive that will copy files to /usr/bin/ and /usr/share/assseq/,
and will also install a .desktop link to the start-menu on compatible systems)

- after downloading you will likely need to change the execution rights of the install file:
chmod +x assseq.install.run

- install by issuing command:
sudo ./assseq.install.run
(most likely you need to sudo the installation, if you don't have super user rights to the system see below)

- start the program with command:
assseq (this is a sh-script that will execute java -jar assseq.jar)

-----*** ALTERNATIVE (as non super-user) ***-----

1. Download the archive assseq.tgz from http://ormbunkar.se/assseq/downloads/linux/ and extract it into a folder of your choice
2. Run program from this folder by issuing command ./assseq from the terminal
   (this is a sh-script that will execute command java -jar assseq.jar)

NOTE: If you are running Linux, consider upgrading to Java 8 or Java 9, there is a significant improvement in drawing speed
since it is using Linux built in XRender.
Installation is very simple (1 minute) - http://ormbunkar.se/assseq/#java8install
