Assseq
=======

**Please note this is Alpha software and not fully woorking yet, but keep checking in, hopefully it is ready after summer!**

Assseq (Assemble-(Sanger)-Sequences) is an assembly viewer and editor that integrate assembly software, presently in a test version. To assemble sequences, load the reads (File->Add sequences from file) and then assemble (Assemble->Reassemble everything with internal/external assembler). Batch assembly functionality will be implemented in first release version. There are installers to download installers for Windows/Mac/Linux [here](https://ormbunkar.se/assseq/downloads/). The internal assembler is also available as a stand alone program [here](https://github.com/RybergGroup/ASSSeqASS).
